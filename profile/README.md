Astro Seed - Botanical Cyborg: Robotic Arm for Terra Pod's Plant Maintenance
<!--Proposer: Vishnu Bhargav vishnubhargav031@gmail.com or vmuthyal@asu.edu-->
Project Description: Overview:

 AstroSeed invites you to partake in an ambitious project: the design and development of a robotic arm that will carry out labor-intensive tasks within the Terra Pod. The Terra Pod is an innovative, self-sustaining ecosystem designed for growing plants in extreme environments. Your contribution to this project will be key in achieving substantial labor cost reductions, as well as enhancing efficiency and accuracy of plant care within the system.

Please go through the documents provided to know more about Terra pod but briefly, Terra Pod is an enclosed, controlled-environment agricultural system that uses aeroponic technology, precision sensors, and AI to optimize plant growth and yields. It allows for indoor precision farming virtually anywhere while using fewer resources than traditional agriculture.

Challenge: 

The prime challenge of this project lies in automating various labor-intensive tasks performed in the Terra Pod. These tasks include pruning, harvesting, and general plant care. The key is to evaluate these tasks for their suitability for automation and to design a robotic arm capable of performing them with precision, efficiency, and safety. The difficulty in replicating human dexterity and sensitivity in a robotic mechanism poses a significant challenge.

Impact: 

The successful development and integration of a robotic arm will usher in a new era of autonomous plant care within the Terra Pod system. This leap in innovation not only reduces labor costs and increases efficiency, but also paves the way for the deployment of Terra Pod systems in remote or inhospitable locations where regular human intervention might be challenging. By working on this project, you will have the opportunity to influence the field of space agriculture and indoor farming, contributing to the vision of making life sustainable in extreme environments, be it the poles, deserts, or even other planets.
Student Learning Goals: In this project, you'll embark on a multidimensional learning journey that intersects the realms of robotics, computer vision, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and automation in agriculture. Here are some specific learning experiences and opportunities that you'll be a part of:

    • Mechatronics and Robotics: Gain hands-on experience in designing, building, and programming a robotic arm. You will deepen your understanding of mechatronics and robotics, from the design process to real-world implementation.

    • ROS (Robot Operating System): ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. You'll learn to use this platform to develop applications for the robotic arm, allowing it to perform complex operations seamlessly.

    • Computer Vision: The robotic arm will need to 'see' and 'understand' its surroundings to perform its tasks. This project will equip you with practical experience in applying computer vision techniques to enable this feature.

    • Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning: The control software you'll develop will incorporate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling the robot to learn from its actions and improve over time. You'll gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms and how to implement them in real-world scenarios.

    • Automation in Agriculture: Agriculture is rapidly embracing automation. Through this project, you'll gain insights into the challenges and solutions for automating agricultural processes, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable farming practices.

The AstroSeed team will coordinate meetings at least once a week. These could be on ASU's campus or virtually, depending on circumstances. You'll use these meetings to share progress, troubleshoot challenges, and plan ahead.

At AstroSeed, you won't be working on abstract problems. Instead, you'll address real-world issues that have practical implications, contributing to a project that aims to redefine sustainable living and agriculture in extreme environments. This opportunity to create value and witness your work's direct impact will indeed be an exciting aspect of your involvement.



Deliverables:
By the end of the two-semester sequence, the students are expected to deliver the following:

    1. Functional Robotic Arm: A physical prototype of a robotic arm capable of performing identified tasks, such as pruning, harvesting, and general plant care in the Terra Pod.

    2. Robotic Arm Control Software: The software for controlling the robotic arm, which can work autonomously or semi-autonomously. This software should be able to integrate seamlessly with the existing Terra Pod system.

    3. Software Documentation: Detailed documentation of the control software. This should include the software's architecture, its functionalities, and instructions on how to use it.

    4. Performance Assessment: An evaluation report showcasing the robotic arm's accuracy, efficiency, and safety in performing the identified tasks. This will include methods used for testing, results of the tests, and any suggestions for future improvements.

    5. Project Report: A comprehensive project report detailing the entire process of identifying tasks for automation, designing, building the robotic arm, and the results of its implementation within the Terra Pod. This report should also include challenges encountered during the project and how they were resolved.

    6. Presentation: A final presentation demonstrating the functionality of the robotic arm and its impact on the Terra Pod's operations.

    7. Source Code and Data: All the source code used for the project, including scripts for ROS, computer vision, deep learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms, along with any collected data, should be shared following appropriate guidelines for reproducibility and further development.
Desired Background:
For this project, we are looking for a team of students with a combination of skills in both hardware and software areas, given the nature of the project which involves building a physical robotic arm and developing software to control it.
Here is a list of the desired background and skills:

    1. Robotics: The core of this project is the development of a robotic arm. Knowledge and experience in robotics, including understanding of robotics hardware, robot kinematics and dynamics are crucial.

    2. Control Systems: Understanding of control systems and algorithms to control the movement and operation of the robotic arm.

    3. Programming Languages: Proficiency in Python and C++ is essential for software development and integration. These are also common languages used in robotics and machine learning tasks.

    4. Machine Learning: Familiarity with machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms. This will aid in the development of a system that can learn and adapt over time.

    5. Computer Vision: Experience with computer vision techniques, as the project involves the use of vision systems for tasks such as identifying plants and navigating the Terra Pod environment.

    6. ROS (Robot Operating System): Given that ROS is widely used in robotics research and development, prior experience or willingness to learn ROS would be highly beneficial. It will be the backbone for controlling the robotic arm and integrating with other systems.

    7. Embedded Systems: Understanding of embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensors and actuators, and related hardware-software integration is beneficial due to the real-world, physical aspect of the project.

    8. Mechanical Design: Knowledge of mechanical design and CAD software tools could be beneficial for the development of the robotic arm structure.

While the above skills are desired, we understand that not every student will possess all of these skills. A team with a diverse skill set, with different team members bringing different expertise to the project would be ideal. Motivation, curiosity, and willingness to learn new things are equally, if not more, important.

Remember, AstroSeed is an interdisciplinary team and you will have access to a variety of experts to guide you and provide support, especially in plant sciences and life sciences-related aspects. The critical factor is a desire to apply your skills to a real-world problem and make a difference!
